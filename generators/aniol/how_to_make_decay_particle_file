1) In the file "hyperon.h", which is used in hyperon-gen.cpp
  a) select the hyperon by using "double myhp = ..." for the hyperon you want
     and comment out the hyperons you don't want
  b) select the step size in dPt and dPk

2) g++ hyperon-gen.cpp

3) ./a.out
 a) This produces a file called "hyperon_outp.dat". There is a bit of text in the first two
    lines but the rest of the file has "xH yH zH pHx pHy pHz weight" specifying
    the decay position(xH,yH,zH), the hyperon's momentum, (pHx,pHy,pHz) and the
     weight = (number of hyperons)/electron for the moller target
 b) cp hyperon_outp.dat ../hyperons/.

4) Now you want to make a file of the hyperon's decay particles. For this use
   "hyperon_decay.cpp". This file uses "hyperon_decay.h".
   a) edit hyperon_decay.cpp, example for lambda->proton+pi-, insert lines

// setup for lambda->proton+piminus
double alpha=0.645,Sr=0.75,h=-1.,frac=0.64,mhyp=mLambda,ma=mpion,mb=mproton,sign=-1.;
      
where,
alpha = decay asymmetry parameter
Sr = hyperon rest frame polarization (taken to be along Z direction for bremsstrahlung) 
h = helicity, +1. or -1.
frac = branching fraction for this mode of decay
mhyp = mlambda
ma = mpion (generate the pion's momentum spectrum in the lab)
mb = proton (partner of particle ma)
sign = -1. (leave this at -1., this enables Lorentz transformation from center of mass
            to the lab)

   b) g++ hyperon_decay.cpp
   c) ./a.out
   d) input file is from "../hyperons/hyperon_outp.dat"
   e) output file is "hyperon_particle_decays.dat"
      format for file is xH,yH,zH,pax,pay,paz,weighta

where location in space of ma is (xH,yH,zH)
        momentum of ma is (pax,pay,paz)
        weighta = (number of particles a)/electron
        this file can be an event generator for geant simulation
--------------------------------------------------------

If you want to do a root analysis of the "hyperon_particle_decays.dat" file,
 an example script uses

a) cp hyperon_particle_decays.dat ../hyperons/.
b) root
in root type ".x hyperon_particles_plot.cxx("4")"

sample histograms are plotted
