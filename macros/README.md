# Simulation Macros

Macros with the word `example` in the name are intended to be instructive and documented.

## runexample.mac

This macro runs the default configuration.

## tests/ directory

This directory tree includes numerous macros which are run on every commit to the repository. This means that they almost by definition work without crashing. In particular, the macros in `tests/commit/` are written to demonstrate reasonable running conditions for each of the generators.
