// Simple example macro for reroot analysis of remoll simulations for MOLLER
//
//  Need to use reroot (CERN's root compiled with special remoll libraries,
//  or root when you have linked to ibremoll.so, i.e. by a command like
//    setenv LD_PRELOAD build/libremoll.so
//  needs to have a subdirectory "images/NewPT" defined for the images to go to
//
//  Run using (for example):
//   build/reroot
//   .L scripts/PunchThru90C12ep.C
//   PunchThru90C12ep()
//
//  Can put multiple root files in the script, and they will be chained together. You must
//  specify which root files that this should run over.

//  This script was written with the intention of looking at ep scattering on the C12
//  thin target, but the script should work for any event generator and any target.
//
//  This script will take root files of a certain sieve thickness, 90mm. It will first loop
//  through the events and flag any in which a primary particle hits a sieve hole.
//  Then it will exclude these flagged events and plot electrons and positrons that hit
//  upstream and downstream of the surface of the sieve. Those particles that hit
//  downstream of the surface are flagged as "punch through particles".
//  Punch-through particles are plotted on the rings of the main detector. An
//  xy plot and radial plot are included. Finally, all charged particles that reach the
//  main detector rings are plotted (xy and r).
//
//  Addition: I now also plot electrons and positrons that hit the main detector after
//  passing through the sieve holes. This is so that I can look at the amount of noise our
//  signal is likely to see.
