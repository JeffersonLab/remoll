The output trees are organized into several indepdent arrays

ev.*   - generated event info
part.* - initial particles
bm.*   - beam information
hit.*  - detector hits
sum.*  - detector sums
units.* - stored units

hit.pid		Geant4 particle type
hit.trid	Geant4 track ID number (1 = first particle created)
hit.mtrid	Geant4 mother track ID number (0 = particle from gun)
hit.gen		Generator (not yet implemented)
hit.[xyz]	Hit coordinate, lab frame [mm]
hit.[xyz]l	Hit coordinate, local solid frame [mm]
hit.r		Hit radial coordinate, lab frame [mm]
hit.p		Momentum magnitude of particle [MeV]
hit.p[xyz]	Momentum components of particle, lab frame [MeV]
hit.s[xyz]	Polarization components of particle, lab frame [1]
hit.v[xyz]	Creation vertex of particles [mm]
hit.e		Energy of particle [MeV]

sum data - array variable:
sum.det		Detector number
sum.vid		Volume ID number (not yet implemented)
sum.edep	Total energy deposited in detector [MeV]


Hint: if you wish to plot tree variables not in their stored units, use the
units tree to renormalize them:
  T->Draw("hit.pz/GeV:hit.z/m")
This will plot momentum in GeV versus position in meters (and even label the
axes accordingly).
